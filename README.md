# Roblox Cookie Logger
#### NOTE: THIS IS FOR ETHICAL USE ONLY; I DO NOT WANT TO SEE PEOPLE USING THIS TO SPREAD HARM.
A Proof of concept Roblox Studio cookie logger.    

Take a look at this registry key in the editor: `Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Roblox\RobloxStudioBrowser\roblox.com`    
Anything look off? Yes, your Roblox session tokens are stored there. This creates an easy way to grab someone's token.    

Roblox, please store your cookies somewhere different. This is stupid.
